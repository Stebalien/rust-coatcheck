# CoatCheck

CoatCheck is a library for storing values and referencing them by "handles"
(`Tickets`). This library is primarily designed for when one needs to be able
to "register" an object with a system and refer to it after registration but
one doesn't need to actually access the object.

Please see the [API](https://stebalien.github.io/rust-coatcheck/coatcheck/)
documentation for a more detailed description.
